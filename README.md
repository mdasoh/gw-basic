# Microsoft GW-BASIC Interpreter Source Code

This repo contains the original source-code for Microsoft's GW-BASIC interpreter, as of 1983,
adjusted for assembling with available versions of the Microsoft Macro Assembler.

## Progress

All files can now be assembled with Microsoft MASM 5.1A.
This is the version that currently seems to match the code most closely.

## Building instructions
Using  [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) mount a directory containing:
* This code
* The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 5.1A (`masm.exe`).
* The Microsoft make program that comes with MASM (`make.exe`).

Run `make makefile` to assemble the files.
Note the tools may leave behind  party-built executables or object files.
If you want to rebuild them without changing the source code, you need
to delete these files by hand.

You can fetch MASM 5.1A from
[this site](https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/lang/microsoft/masm/5.10x/) as follows.
* From the pull-down menu select `MS MAcro Assembler 5.10A (Update)`
* Press the `Load` button to load the disk image into the emulator
* Press the `Save` button to save the disk image to your computer
* Copy  the saved disk image to a Linux computer
* Mount the image using the command `sudo mount MASM51A-UPDATE.img /mnt`
* Copy the files from `/mnt` to your development directory
